Python Homework - Py Me Up, Charlie
GETTING STARTED
* Created a new repository for this project called python-challenge. 
* Cloned the python-challenge repository to my computer. 

* Inside git repository-
    *  Created a directory for each Python Challenge and PyPoll.
    *  Created separate folders named PyBank and PyPoll for corresponding to the challenges: PyBank and PyPoll.
        * Inside of each folder, created:
            * A new file called main.py. 
            * A "Resources" folder that contains the CSV files used. 
            * An "analysis" folder that contains your text file that has the results from your analysis.
    * Lastly, pushed the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.

PyBank

* Created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company using the financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.  
* Created a Python script that analyzes the records and calculates:
    * The total number of months included in the dataset
    * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    * Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
    * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

PyPoll
(Please refer to Main1.py. I could not get main.py off of the repository)

* Created a Python script to assist rural town in modernizing its vote counting process. 
* Created a Python script for analyzing the poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate.

* Created a Python script that analyzes the records and calculates:
    * The total number of votes cast
    * A complete list of candidates who received votes
    * The percentage of votes each candidate won
    * The total number of votes each candidate won
    * The winner of the election based on popular vote.
